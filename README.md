# Class4Corona

An e-learning environment for schools that have closed during the COVID-19 pandemic developed by **Rohan Shetty**, **Wilson Wang**, and **Matthews Ma**

## Teach

Class4Corona lets teachers start a live session in 10 seconds. Simply click the "Create Class" button on the home page, follow the setup, and you're live!

You have the option to enable webcam or leave it off, as well as share your screen if you wish. You can also post a handout for students to print out and work on during or after the lesson.

## Learn

Class4Corona is ideal for students. Click the "Join Class" button on the home page, search for your class and join.
To increase security, each session is protected with a 7-character code. Your teacher can send you the code via Google Classroom, email, etc. and you can join the lesson.

A chat is available to submit your questions at any time, but if you have an important question that requires an actual conversation with your teacher, just click the "Raise Hand" button. Your teacher can choose to call on you, which will turn on your microphone and allow you to speak. You can choose to keep the question private or share it with the rest of your class.

## How to use it?

Head to [class4corona.com](https://class4corona.com).
If you are a teacher, click "Create Class", and if you are a student, click "Join Class".
Follow the process to host or join a session.
As a teacher, click "start stream" to begin hosting your class. As a student, the stream should appear automatically when the teacher starts hosting.
